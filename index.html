            <p class="privacy-policy">This website is hosted externally. Personal data collected on this website is
                stored on the servers of

            <h3 class="privacy-policy">Data Protection</h3>
            <p class="privacy-policy">The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very
                seriously. We treat your
                personal
                data confidentially and in accordance with statutory data protection regulations and this privacy
                policy.

                explains how and for what purpose this happens.</p>
            <p class="privacy-policy">We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when
                communicating via email)
                can
                have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>
            <h3 class="privacy-policy">Notice regarding the responsible party</h3>
            <p class="privacy-policy">The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
            <p class="privacy-policy">Joel Baig<br />
                Hansestra√üe 92<br />
                48282 Emsdetten</p>

            <p class="privacy-policy">Phone: 017631277596<br />
                Email: ibaig@web.de</p>
            <p class="privacy-policy">The responsible party is the natural or legal person who, alone or jointly with
                others, decides on the
                purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</p>

            <h3 class="privacy-policy">Storage Duration</h3>
            <p class="privacy-policy">Unless a more specific storage period is stated within this privacy policy, your
                personal data will
                remain
                with us until the purpose for the data processing ceases to apply. If you submit a legitimate request
                for
                deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other
                legally
                permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., retention periods under tax or commercial
                law); in
                the latter case, deletion takes place after these reasons no longer apply.</p>
            <h3 class="privacy-policy">General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on this Website</h3>
            <p class="privacy-policy">If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data based on
                Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR
                or
                Art. 9 (2) lit. a GDPR if special categories of data according to Art. 9 (1) GDPR are processed. In the
                event of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is
                additionally based on Art. 49 (1) lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to
                access
                information in your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally
                based
                on Section 25 (1) TDDG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required to fulfill a
                contract
                or carry out pre-contractual measures, we process your data based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR.
                Furthermore, we
                process your data if it is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6 (1) lit. c GDPR. The
                data
                processing may also be carried out based on our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR.
                The
                relevant legal basis in each individual case is explained in this privacy policy.</p>
            <h3 class="privacy-policy">Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
            <p class="privacy-policy">In the course of our business activities, we work with various external entities.
                In some cases, the
                transfer
                of personal data to these external parties is necessary. We only pass on personal data to external
                parties
                if this is necessary for contract fulfillment, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., transfer of
                data to
                tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR, or if another
                legal
                basis permits data transfer. When using processors, we only pass on personal data to them based on a
                valid
                contract for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is
                concluded.
            </p>
            <h3 class="privacy-policy">Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
            <p class="privacy-policy">Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You
                can revoke consent you
                have
                already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out up until the revocation
                remains
                unaffected by the revocation.</p>
            <h3 class="privacy-policy">Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising
                (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
            <p class="privacy-policy">IF DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT BASED ON ART. 6 (1) LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE
                THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO
                THE
                PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS
                ALSO
                APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH A PROCESSING IS
                BASED
                CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL
                DATA
                UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS,
                RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE, OR DEFEND LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION
                PURSUANT TO ART. 21 (1) GDPR).</p>
            <p class="privacy-policy">IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE
                RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE
                PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY TIME; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
                PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA
                WILL
                NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 (2) GDPR).</p>
            <h3 class="privacy-policy">Right to Complain to the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
            <p class="privacy-policy">In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a
                complaint with a
                supervisory
                authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work, or the place of
                the
                alleged infringement. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to any other administrative or
                judicial remedies.</p>
            <h3 class="privacy-policy">Right to Data Portability</h3>
            <p class="privacy-policy">You have the right to have data that we process automatically based on your
                consent or in fulfillment of
                a
                contract handed over to you or a third party in a commonly used, machine-readable format. If you request
                the
                direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only take place if it is technically
                feasible.</p>
            <h3 class="privacy-policy">Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
            <p class="privacy-policy">Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any
                time to free

                data. To do so, you can
                contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this.
                    For
                    the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
                    personal data.</li>
                <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data
                    processing instead of deletion.</li>
                <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the establishment, exercise, or defense
                    of
                    legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data

                <li>If you have filed an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR, a balance must be made between your
                    interests and ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to
                    request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
            </ul>
