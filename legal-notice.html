        <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal
            data confidentially and in accordance with statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.

        <p>We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating via email) can
            have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>
        <h3>Notice regarding the responsible party</h3>
        <p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
        <p>Joel Baig<br />
            Hansestraße 92<br />
            48282 Emsdetten</p>

        <p>Phone: 017631277596<br />
            Email: ibaig@web.de</p>
        <p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who, alone or jointly with others, decides on the
            purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</p>

        <h3>Storage Duration</h3>
        <p>Unless a more specific storage period is stated within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain
            with us until the purpose for the data processing ceases to apply. If you submit a legitimate request for
            deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally
            permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., retention periods under tax or commercial law); in
            the latter case, deletion takes place after these reasons no longer apply.</p>
        <h3>General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on this Website</h3>
        <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR or
            Art. 9 (2) lit. a GDPR if special categories of data according to Art. 9 (1) GDPR are processed. In the
            event of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is
            additionally based on Art. 49 (1) lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to access
            information in your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based
            on Section 25 (1) TDDG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required to fulfill a contract
            or carry out pre-contractual measures, we process your data based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we
            process your data if it is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6 (1) lit. c GDPR. The data
            processing may also be carried out based on our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. The
            relevant legal basis in each individual case is explained in this privacy policy.</p>
        <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
        <p>In the course of our business activities, we work with various external entities. In some cases, the transfer
            of personal data to these external parties is necessary. We only pass on personal data to external parties
            if this is necessary for contract fulfillment, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., transfer of data to
            tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR, or if another legal
            basis permits data transfer. When using processors, we only pass on personal data to them based on a valid
            contract for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.
        </p>
        <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
        <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke consent you have
            already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out up until the revocation remains
            unaffected by the revocation.</p>
        <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>

            PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO
            APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH A PROCESSING IS BASED
            CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA
            UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS,
            RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE, OR DEFEND LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION
            PURSUANT TO ART. 21 (1) GDPR).</p>
        <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE
            PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY TIME; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
            PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL

        <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
            authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work, or the place of the
            alleged infringement. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to any other administrative or
            judicial remedies.</p>
        <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
        <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a
            contract handed over to you or a third party in a commonly used, machine-readable format. If you request the
            direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only take place if it is technically
            feasible.</p>
        <h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
        <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information
            about your stored personal data, its origin, and recipient, the purpose of data processing, and, if
            applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose and any further questions
            regarding personal data, you can contact us at any time.</p>
        <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
        <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. To do so, you can
            contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For
                the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
                personal data.</li>
            <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data
                processing instead of deletion.</li>
            <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the establishment, exercise, or defense of
                legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data
                instead of deletion.</li>
            <li>If you have filed an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR, a balance must be made between your
                interests and ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to
                request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data may only be processed – apart from
            their storage – with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the
            protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of significant public interest of
            the European Union or a member state.</p>
